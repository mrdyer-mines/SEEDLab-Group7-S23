This is a repository containing our code for the SEED Lab Demonstration 1.

Demo1controller is the simulation and control's code, demo1encoders is the localization's code, and printangles is the computer vision's code.

The demo1arduino and demo1python are the two final combined programs that system integration completed. These 2 programs integrate the previous 3 programs described above in order to run the entire system together and with the same parameters and units.
