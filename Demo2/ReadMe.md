This is a repository containing our code for the SEED Lab Demonstration 2.


The Demo2ArduinoFinal and Demo2PythonFinal are the two final combined revisions that system integration completed, and we demoed in-class 04/07.
Previous revisions are documented in Demo2PythonR1, Demo2PythonR2, Demo2ArduinoR1, Demo2ArduinoR2. We worked as a team to improve these revisions.
We also utilized distance.py and print_angles.py to create our final revisions and run the system together with the right parameters and units.
